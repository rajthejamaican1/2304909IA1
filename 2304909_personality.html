            <h2>Strongest Trait: Friendliness</h2>
            <p>My strongest trait is friendliness. As the Planning and Logistics Director for the School of Computing and Information Technology, my friendly nature has been instrumental in fostering a collaborative and supportive environment. This trait helps me build strong relationships with peers and faculty, making it easier to coordinate events and manage logistics effectively. Friendliness also enhances my ability to mentor first-year students, providing them with a welcoming and approachable resource as they navigate their academic journey.</p>

            <h2>My Hero: Barack Obama</h2>
            <p>Barack Obama is a figure I deeply admire for his leadership, resilience, and commitment to positive change. As the 44th President of the United States, he demonstrated qualities such as conviction, perseverance, and the ability to inspire hope and unity among people. His journey from a community organizer to the highest office in the land is a testament to his dedication and belief in the power of collective action.</p>
